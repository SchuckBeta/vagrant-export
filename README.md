# Vagrant Export

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) plugin to export compressed and optimized linux boxes from virtualbox into a .box file

## Installation

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-export
```

## Useage

```bash
vagrant export
```
Exports the current box into a .box file. The file name is determined by the setting `config.vm.name`, were slashes are replaced with underscores.

So a Vagrantfile with this setting:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	config.vm.name = "hashicorp/precise32"
end
```

will be exported to a file named `hashicorp_precise32.box`
